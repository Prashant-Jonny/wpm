This is an attempt to create a package manager for the Whitix operating system.

The package format
------------------
The package will be an archive which contains two directories: data & metadata.
The data folder will contain all files to be extracted from the package. Nothing fancy here.
The metadata directory should always contain a file called metadata.xml.
This file will contain all metadata requiared for the package to be installed:
	-internal and external version
	-title and name
	-some description
	-optional and required dependencies
	-and maybe some other stuff....
The metadata directory also may contain some scripts to be executed before/after package installation/removal.
